//Script to read through the 3 selected files
//Plots important kinematic variables one at a time
//Script modified each time a new variable need (just easier that way)
//This pulls from the unfiltered MC files -> Reads from file, tree, fills histogram with leaf information
//I had the canvas opened and manually saved it, in order to move the legend around so it wouldn't cover the plot lines
//I created plots of lep_pt, lep_eta, lep_phi, jet_pt, jet_eta, and met
//These plots were saved and I emailed to you
