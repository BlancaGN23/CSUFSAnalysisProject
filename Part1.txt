CSU Fresno State CERN Computing Class, Spring 2020
Analysis Final Project for Gabriel

Part 1:

WW boson pair production, via quark-antiquark annihilation

Final State signature:
     2 jets (quark hadronization)
     1 lepton
     MeT from corresponding neutrino
     
Other processes that share the same signature:
     WZ -> lepton + neutrino + 2jets     
     ttbar -> lepton + neutrino + 2jets
     
What samples from list of datasets to use?  -----????
     Only use WW samples, since that is what we're interested in
     As well as the two given data sample sets
